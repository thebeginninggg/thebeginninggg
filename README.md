i'm trying to create an application that can go to email serivce providers and register an account 
on its own using faker to generate user data and twilio to recieve otp's....

this is what i got so far....
im running into issues... 
for one... making sure the script identifies the proper elements on the registration pages
for second... email service providers don't like the twilio number, so i need to find an alternative
third.... sometimes the usernames arent unique and it stalls out
fourth... there's alot more than four issues, please help 

lets collaborate 
messag me XMPP greygoat@yax.im
